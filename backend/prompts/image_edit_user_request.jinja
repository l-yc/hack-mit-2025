# User Input Edit Prompt

Objective: Apply ONLY the requested change while keeping everything else exactly the same.

Requested change:
{{ edit_request }}

Strict rules:
- Do not alter the rest of the image beyond what is strictly necessary to satisfy the request.
- Preserve composition, lighting, color palette, identities, and textures.
- Match the existing sceneâ€™s perspective, scale, shadows, reflections, and materials.
- If adding or replacing an element, integrate seamlessly (edges, lighting, shadows, reflections, and noise profile).
- If removing an element, inpaint background plausibly and consistently.

Prohibited changes:
- No additional style changes, retouching, or enhancements unless explicitly requested.
- No deletions or additions other than what is specified above.

Output constraints:
- Photorealistic output that blends with the original image.
- Maintain aspect ratio and resolution (or nearest available resolution if required by the model).

Instruction:
Make the single requested change described in {{ edit_request }} and return an image otherwise identical to the original.
