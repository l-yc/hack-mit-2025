# Image Cleanup Prompt (Initial Sweep)

Objective: Produce a clean, high‑quality version of the provided photo while keeping the scene, composition, and identities unchanged.

Do:
- Reduce noise and compression artifacts; remove banding.
- Correct exposure, dynamic range, and white balance; fix color casts.
- Improve local contrast and clarity; sharpen gently (no halos/oversharpening).
- Remove red‑eye; tame glare/reflections on skin and glasses while preserving realism.
- Remove dust, sensor spots, and minor distracting specks; dehaze if needed.
- Straighten horizons; correct lens distortion and chromatic aberration.
- Preserve natural skin texture; avoid plastic skin. Remove only temporary blemishes.

Don’t:
- Do not add, remove, move, or restyle objects, people, text, or backgrounds.
- Do not change composition, pose, clothing, or time of day.
- Do not stylize or alter artistic intent.

Output constraints:
- Keep the image photorealistic and natural.
- Maintain original aspect ratio and resolution (or nearest available resolution if required by the model).
- Apply only minimal cropping necessary to remove black borders or edge artifacts.

Instruction:
Clean up the image according to the rules above and return a refined version that looks like the same photo, just higher quality and professionally corrected.
