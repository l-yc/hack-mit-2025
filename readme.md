# About the Project
We are a group of MIT students part of student organizations that need to advertise large events. For any event, you will have a bunch of photos coming in, but not all of them are good. You can spend hours sifting through photos, editing them to make it pop, and coming up with a pithy caption, just to have the post flop. Or, you can let AI do it for you, with representative demographic agents that digest your library, suggest photos, and curate a post for you.
